🔄 Recap Roadmap in Simple Terms

Phase 1: AI search bar → find product easily.

Phase 2: AI knows me → personalized suggestions.

Phase 3: AI knows my trip → contextual bundles.

Phase 4: AI helps me pay → loyalty + alt payments.

Phase 5: AI manages my journey → orchestrates orders.

Phase 6: AI runs a marketplace → new airline revenue streams.


Details:

Phase 1 → Agentic AI search assistant inside airline mobile app, helping customers find products quickly.


Phase 2 → Added personalization (basic trip/loyalty context), logging, monitoring, QA, and stronger SDK/API package.


Phase 3 – Context-Aware & Bundling (2–3 sprints)

Goal: Move from “search assistant” → “travel shopping concierge.”

AI uses context: route, destination, time-to-departure, season.

Recommends bundles: e.g., “Flying to Paris? Add Wi-Fi + SIM card + wine gift bundle.”

Dynamic business rules (high-margin items get surfaced).

Airline app still handles payment & checkout (deep links).

Product Increment:

Context enrichment module in API.

Bundle engine (group complementary products).

A/B test in demo app: context-aware vs. generic search.


Phase 4 – Loyalty & Payments Integration (3–4 sprints)

Goal: Start making AI part of the checkout experience.

AI shows which products can be redeemed via miles/points.

Supports multi-currency price display (cash + miles mix).

Introduce IATA Pay / alt-payment support (if airline agrees).

Product Increment:

Loyalty API connector (tokenized, read-only).

Price enrichment engine (miles, points, mixed).

Deep links extended with loyalty redemption flags.


Phase 5 – Agentic Orchestration (4–6 sprints)

Goal: Make AI an active orchestrator beyond catalog search.

Handles order reservation (hold item until flight).

Reacts to flight status changes (delays, cancellations → adjusts pickup/delivery).

Talks to multiple partners (duty-free, transport, hotels).

Product Increment:

Airline-hosted connector (read-only PSS / inventory sync).

Event-driven triggers (flight delay → update retail orders).

Fulfillment webhooks with partner retailers.


Phase 6 – Open Marketplace & Airline Revenue Model (ongoing)

Goal: Make AeroShop a B2B2C marketplace layer.

Third-party brands plug into AeroShop (not just airline catalog).

AI orchestrates across multiple merchants → bigger revenue share for airline.

Airlines get commission dashboards & analytics.



Product Increment:

Marketplace API for partners.

Airline analytics dashboard (conversion, commissions).

SKU onboarding pipeline for partners.

Show management how AI can now proactively suggest bundles instead of just reactive search.

This moves you from “AI as search” → “AI as upsell driver.”
